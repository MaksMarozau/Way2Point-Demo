The application is built on the MVVM architecture. UINavigationControllers and UITabBarController are used for navigation between screens. The relationships are built using the Coordinator pattern approach. Data passing is based on the use of closures.

The application structure consists of 5 TabBar's items. However, it has nested screens.

The base framework for UI was chosen as UIKit. The application implements a large stack of various UI components: UITableView, UICollectionView, Animations, UITextField, UITextView, UIStackView, UIAlertController, UIImagePickerController, etc.

The application's functionality is provided by a large number of managers:
-Data storage is implemented using CoreData and UserDefaults.
-Error handling and user notifications are provided through UIAlertController via ErrorsManager and UserNotificationManager.
-GPS update is done using LocationManager.
-The update of the mobile device's orientation relative to the north is done using CompassManager.

Extensions for UIView, UIStackView, UIButton, Double, etc., are implemented.

The following frameworks were used in the work: UIKit, CoreData, CoreLocation, CoreMotion, MapKit.
